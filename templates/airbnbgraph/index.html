    Welcome to Airbnb  Analysis!
  </h1>
  <div class="container-fluid" style="position: relative; left: 325px; width: 500px">
    <p> For our mini project we have decided to do Airbnb analysis for Selangor and Kuala Lumpur area as both of this area is the most visited place and where the capital city is.
        Nowadays, we used the word staycation a lot campared to vacation due to Covid-19. When MCO's restricted had been lifted, people were excited as they can go to the nearest Airbnb for staycation.
        Therefore, this analysis was done to look at the data of Airbnb and do the comparison between the two states.</p>

                    <p>From the graph above, Kuala Lumpur has the highest number of frequency, however, we can also see there are Bukit Bintang and Cheras which is part of Kuala Lumpur but it was separated in different column.</p>

                    <p>From the graph above, we can see more than half of the AirBnb price is lower than RM 500 and there are some of Airbnb cost more than RM 1000, and the mavimum price is near to RM 3000</p>

                    <p>We used percentage to display this graph as the number of Airbnb in the price range is not the same. From the graph we can see most of the Airbnb with higher price range starting RM 600 and above has pool access for at least 80% of each of the price range. Meanwhile, for the lower price range we can see that most of it has no pool access. </p>

                        <p>From the graph above, it is safe for us to assume that most of Airbnb provides Wifi access. It is alo quite interesting to see that 25% of Airbnb from price range more that 1000 do not provide Wifi access</p>
